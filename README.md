## Build Script

I attempted to automate the build process, from initial minification with Closure Compiler to crushing with RegPack. However, I was unable to get this to work, plus I reached the stage at which it was easier to work with the minified code directly.

Nontheless, the recorded bundle sizes data should still serve as an accurate means of determining how the build sizes changed as my entry progressed. I will graph this as part of my post-mortem.
